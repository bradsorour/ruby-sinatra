Unlike Rails, there’s no enforcement of concepts like MVC or REST in Sinatra. Sinatra is very “at the bare metal” in terms of its functionality. You can write an entire app in a single Ruby file if you wish, or, alternatively, you can develop lots of classes, sprawl your app out over hundreds of files, and really go to town. Sinatra is permissive of almost any development style and offers no Rails-like formula or constraints.

## usage
Run the app with `ruby myapp.rb` 

A HTTP server will start on your local machine on port 4567. You can try to access it at http://localhost:4567/
